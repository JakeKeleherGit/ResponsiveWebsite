# ResponsiveWebsite

I developed a website utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a clean and responsive layout. The design leverages the flexibility of CSS Grid for structured, multi-dimensional layouts, while CSS Flexbox is used for aligning and distributing elements within the grid.

To enhance the user experience, I implemented a smooth scrolling effect using JavaScript. The JavaScript code is minimal, mostly consisting of simple if and else statements, ensuring the scrolling transitions are fluid and visually appealing.

This website showcases a modern approach to web design, balancing structure and interactivity with clean, efficient code.
